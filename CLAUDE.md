# EXR → sRGB

Batch converter: ACES-linear EXR → display-ready PNG/JPEG, using OpenColorIO's
built-in ACES configs so the result matches the renderer's viewport rather than a
gamma guess. Public on `visor-ooo/EXRtoSRGB`, MIT. The README is the user
documentation; `ROADMAP.md` tracks what's next and why.

App, module, exe and repo are all named **EXR → sRGB** as of v2.0. The repo was
renamed from `EXRtoPNG` on 2026-08-07; GitHub redirects the old URL, so old clones
and links still resolve.

It moved from the `visorooo` user account to the **`visor-ooo` org** on
2026-10-22; `gabe-xyz` is an org owner, so settings work from it.

**The updater follows the org from v3.3.1.** `RELEASES_API`, `ASSET_PREFIX`,
`REPO_URL` and `VISOR_GITHUB` in `exr2srgb.py` (plus `installer.iss`,
`ui/app.js`, `ui/index.html`) point at `visor-ooo`, and `tests/test_updater.py`
refuses a `visorooo` asset URL. v3.3.1 is the first release carrying them
(published 2026-10-22; the macOS `.dmg` went up first as a pre-release, the
Windows installer followed and the release is Latest).

Installed copies up to v3.3.0 still have `visorooo` baked in. Checked against
the live API with v3.3.0's own updater: the check still finds new releases
through GitHub's redirect, then `download_update` refuses the `visor-ooo`
asset URL with *"refusing to download from outside the release page"* and the
UI offers the release page. So each of those copies needs **one manual
install** of 3.3.1 or later; the release notes say so.

**So the `visorooo` account is kept dormant, permanently** - never deleted,
never converted to an org, and **no repo is ever created on it again**.
Those copies keep asking `visorooo` for releases: delete the account and the
username frees up immediately, and whoever re-registered it would sit at
exactly the path baked into their `ASSET_PREFIX`, pass their own check, and
get an installer executed on those machines. Creating a repo there is the
same hazard from the other direction - `visorooo/EXRtoSRGB` 301-redirects to
the org today, which is the only reason those copies still see new releases
at all, and a new repo taking that name kills the redirect.

The rule used to read "while they are in use". That condition can never be
checked: the app has ~30 downloads across every release and GitHub downloads
are anonymous. A dormant account costs nothing, so it stays. The decision is
recorded for the studio in the visor Shared drive at
`00_ADMIN/07_Tools/github-visor-ooo/MIGRACAO_GITHUB_VISOR-OOO.md`.

## Shape of the code

```
EXRtoSRGB.exe     the build, written to the repo root so it is easy to find.
cli.py            the scriptable entry point. imports core only, never a window.
app.ico           the aperture, multi-size. wired into the spec and the window.
app.icns          the same aperture for macOS, rebuilt at 1024 by make_icns.py.
core.py           conversion. no UI imports. this is what the tests exercise.
exr2srgb.py       pywebview window + the Api bridge exposed to JavaScript.
macos.py          macOS shell integration. imported only on darwin. see below.
EXRtoSRGB-mac.spec / build_mac.sh   the .app and .dmg. output in dist/.
ui/theme.css      the warm-neutral palette. colour tokens only, no layout.
ui/app.css        application styles, built only on theme.css tokens.
ui/index.html     markup.
ui/app.js         front end. gathers settings, renders state. no pixel work.
ui/select.js      custom animated dropdown over a real hidden <select>.
ui/visor-mark.svg the mark on its own, for anywhere it is needed standalone.
ui/viewer.html    standalone viewer window: double-click, or the in-app button.
ui/viewer.css     viewer chrome. the image is the interface, so this is thin.
ui/viewer.js      zoom/pan/probe. transforms are CSS; only pixels come from Python.
tests/test_core.py
```

**Branding.** The mark's geometry is lifted from the vector paths in
`visor.logo-principal.pdf` (VISOR brand drive → Logo), not traced from a bitmap,
so it is exact at any size. Brand blue is **`#1f20f1`**, taken from the artwork
itself. Both icons put brand blue on a warm-50 rounded square rather than the reverse:
at 16px in a taskbar, blue-on-near-black collapses into an unreadable blob
(1.99:1 against 7.53:1 inverted).

**The mark is no longer in the window.** It was inline SVG in the titlebar,
drawn through a `--brand-mark` token that resolved to brand blue on light and
pure white on dark — brand blue on the dark surface is 1.9:1, effectively
invisible. Removed in 3.2.4 at the owner's request; the header now opens on the
wordmark. `--brand-mark` and `--visor-blue` went with it, since nothing else
referenced them, and `ui/visor-mark.svg` is kept for standalone use. The icons
still carry the aperture, so the app is not unbranded — only the titlebar is.

The split is the point: anything touching pixels goes in `core.py` so it can be
tested without opening a window.

**`core.py`**
- **Colour pipeline** — `get_config` / `get_processor` / `view_for` /
  `list_displays` / `list_input_spaces`. Where any colour-correctness question is
  answered. `get_config` takes either a built-in registry name or a path to a
  `config.ocio`.
- **Layer resolution** — `split_channel` / `group_layers` / `score_layer` /
  `pick_layer` / `pick_from_index` / `layer_index` / `probe_layers`. See the
  invariants below.
- **`layer_index`** — every layer across every **part**. Blender's File Output
  node writes one subimage per slot, so a custom AOV pass arrives as 16 parts
  rather than 16 channel groups; reading only part 0 shows one layer and hides
  the rest with nothing to suggest anything is missing. Layers keep their own
  name (Blender prefixes each part's channels with it), falling back to the part
  name and then its index. **Part 0 keeps the empty name** for a plain
  single-part image — the UI and every saved setting rely on that.
- **`layer_tag`** — the filename fragment naming a layer, `""` for the auto case.
  Exporting two layers of one EXR without it silently overwrites: same stem, same
  suffix, same folder. It strips the view-layer prefix, so `ViewLayer.Diffuse Color`
  becomes `_Diffuse_Color` rather than repeating `ViewLayer` on every file.
- **`find_sequence_siblings`** — every frame of the run a path belongs to. Matches
  stem, **padding and extension**, not just the stem: `shot.0001.exr` and
  `shot.000001.exr` are two different renders, and a `.png` beside the frames is
  not part of the sequence. Returns `[path]` unchanged when there is no frame
  number, so callers need no special case.
- **I/O** — `read_layer` (reads only the channels the chosen layer needs),
  `write_image`.
- **`apply_transform` / `compose`** — the transform and the alpha modes, split out
  so `convert_one` and `make_thumbnail` cannot drift apart. `transfer="linear"`
  makes `apply_transform` a passthrough: no OCIO, no alpha juggling, **no clamp**.
- **`resolve_output`** — the single place that decides the real container and
  pixel format. The UI mirrors these rules in `syncFormat()` but does not own
  them, so a settings blob from anywhere still gets checked.
- **`convert_one(path, settings)`** — returns `(out_path, info)`; `info` carries
  the layer used and any warning.
- **`group_sequences`** — collapses `name.0001.exr` runs into one entry.
- **`convert_many`** — the thread pool. Results come back in submission order,
  and the callback runs in the calling thread, so callers need no lock.
- **`ViewerSession`** — the viewer's reason to exist. See below.

**`ViewerSession` and why it is not just `make_thumbnail`.** The converter is a
throughput problem; a viewer is a latency one. One preview frame costs **125 ms at
1080p and 860 ms on a 2160² 80-channel file**, and lowering the preview resolution
barely moves either — the cost is *decoding*, not the transform. So the session
decodes once and keeps it, and also caches the downsampled copy per output size,
because re-scaling the full-resolution layer was another 82 ms every render.
Result: **4.1× at 1080p (23 fps) and 5.6× on the 2160² file**.

Two things that will bite anyone editing `render()`:

- **`apply_transform` writes in place.** The cached array must never be handed to
  it directly; exposure produces a new array, and the zero-exposure path copies.
  A test asserts repeated renders do not mutate the cache.
- **Exposure goes before the transform, gamma after.** Exposure in linear is what
  makes it behave like a camera stop; gamma on display values is what a
  compositor's viewer gamma does. Swapping them changes what both controls mean.

`sample()` returns **both** readings: `r/g/b` are the linear pixel, `dr/dg/db` and
`hex` are what is on screen after exposure, gamma and the view transform. They are
not interchangeable — a hex built from the linear value reads near-black for
anything normally exposed and matches nothing pasted anywhere else. Tests assert
that exposure moves the hex and leaves the linear reading alone.

**Both windows show the chip, and both have the eyedropper.** `Api.probe` takes the
settings for the same reason `ViewerApi.probe` does — without them `sample()` skips
the display chain and there is no hex to show.

**Arming must not be the thing that unlocks.** Taking a sample disarms the
eyedropper, so if disarming also released the lock the reading would resume
following the cursor the instant it was taken — which is the one behaviour the
eyedropper exists to prevent. `setPicking(false)` therefore leaves `locked` alone;
`unlockProbe()` is separate, and `setPicking(true)` calls it because arming again is
a request for a new sample. This was wrong first time round and the symptom is
subtle: the pick appears to work, then quietly drifts on the next mouse move.

**In the viewer a pick is a `pointerup` that did not travel.** Pan and pick are the
same gesture otherwise, so `travel` accumulates during the press and a pick is
refused past 4px. Anything driving this synthetically must send the `pointerdown`
too, or `travel` is stale and nothing happens.

**`exr2srgb.py`** — `class Api` is the JS bridge. Two non-obvious constraints:

- **Every public attribute of `Api` gets introspected by pywebview.** `self.window`
  as a public name sends it recursing into the .NET window object forever, spewing
  `Error while processing window.native...` and breaking the bridge so silently
  that the UI just renders with empty dropdowns. It is `self._window` for that
  reason. Keep non-method state underscore-prefixed.
- **Drag-drop binds with `element.on('drop', ...)`, not `element.events.drop +=`.**
  The events container is generated from properties the DOM node advertises, and a
  plain `<div>` does not advertise a drop event, so the `+=` form raises
  `AttributeError`. The handler runs in Python because that is where pywebview
  injects `pywebviewFullPath`; the browser alone never sees a real path.

### Why drag-drop breaks, and how to tell

Three separate things must hold. Any one missing looks identical from outside —
you drag a file on and nothing happens at all.

1. **`dragover` must call `preventDefault()` in JavaScript.** Without it the page
   is not a drop target and the `drop` event never fires. This cannot be done from
   Python: pywebview dispatches DOM events to a worker thread, long after the
   default would have applied. `wireDrag()` in `ui/app.js` owns this, and owns the
   hover state too, because `dragover` fires continuously and routing it over the
   bridge is a stream of pointless IPC. **This is what was broken in v2.0.**
2. **The `drop` listener must be registered through pywebview**, which increments
   `webview.dom._dnd_state['num_listeners']`. WebView2 only forwards
   `CoreWebView2File` objects when that count is above zero — no listener, no
   paths, even if the event fires.
3. **`DOMEventHandler(on_drop, prevent_default=True)`** on the drop itself, or
   WebView2 navigates away to the dropped file.

Verify with: `_dnd_state['num_listeners'] == 1`, `window.dom._elements` containing
one element whose `_event_handlers['drop']` is non-empty, and a synthetic
`dragover` reporting `defaultPrevented == true`.

**A real drop cannot be simulated.** `postMessageWithAdditionalObjects` rejects
constructed `File` objects — *"additional File object is not a file on the disk"* —
and that throw aborts the bridge call before Python is reached. To exercise the
Python side, call the registered handler directly with
`{"dataTransfer": {"files": [{"name": ..., "pywebviewFullPath": ...}]}}`. The final
mile needs a human dragging from Explorer.

**`private_mode=True` on `webview.start`, and it must stay that way.** Nothing
here uses localStorage — preferences live in a JSON file on the Python side — so a
persistent WebView2 profile buys nothing and costs a cache. After an update that
cache can serve a **stale `viewer.html` against a fresh `viewer.js`**, and the
skew is silent: `wire()` throws on an element that no longer exists, `init()` never
runs, and the window comes up with no name, no layers and no image. It looks like
the backend died when the backend is fine.

Two defences, keep both: private mode removes the cache, and `on(id, event, fn)`
in `viewer.js` binds only when the element exists, with `startup()` wrapped in a
try/catch that reports into `#vmeta`. **A missing control must never be fatal.**

**`cli.py` is a real path to the pixels, not a wrapper.** It imports `core` and
nothing else, so `tests/test_cli.py` stays inside the same no-UI boundary as
`test_core` — and it asserts the **ACES ladder through the CLI**, because a second
route to the same transform is exactly the thing that drifts without anything
failing. `--config` resolves a label, a registry name, a substring or a path, and
**refuses an ambiguous match** rather than guessing; picking one of several configs
silently is how the wrong curve ships. `--cli` is dispatched in `main()` before the
single-instance guard, since a farm may run several at once.

`'cli'` is in the spec's `hiddenimports`: it is imported inside `main()`, so
PyInstaller's static analysis does not see it and `--cli` would work from source
and die with `ModuleNotFoundError` in the exe.

**Presets store everything except `out_dir`.** A preset is how to convert, not
where to put it, and a stale path following you between projects is worse than
picking one each time. Applying one sets the config **first and awaits the colour
lists** before input space and display — written against the previous config's
options they are silently dropped — and ends with `syncFormat()`, which is what
enforces the container rules on a settings blob arriving from outside.

Naming is an inline input rather than a dialog: pywebview has no text prompt and
`window.prompt` is not dependable in WebView2. Its Escape handler calls
`stopPropagation`, or the global one reads the key as cancel-the-convert.

**"Every layer" is a pass per layer, not a new code path.** `_layer_passes` builds
one settings blob per layer with `core.layer_tag()` in the suffix — without that
they all resolve to the same filename and only the last survives. `all_layers` is
popped there so it never reaches `core`.

**Frame stepping re-reads.** The sequence strip steps rather than plays because one
preview frame is 125 ms at 1080p and 860 ms on an 80-channel file, and that is
decode cost — halving the preview barely moves it. The held frame resets when the
selection lands on a different entry, compared **by label, not index**: adding a
file can leave the selection on the same row number while that row is now a
different sequence.

**Single instance is the converter only.** `claim_single_instance()` is called in
`main()` **after** the `--view` and `--convert` early returns, and that ordering is
the design, not an accident: opening several images at once is what a viewer is
for, and the Explorer right-click convert has to run whether or not a converter
window is open. The mutex handle is a module global — letting it be collected
releases the mutex and the guard silently stops working.

**`set_clipboard` is Win32 via ctypes, not `navigator.clipboard`.** The UI is a
`file://` origin, which is opaque, and the async clipboard API is unavailable
there. It fails by rejecting a promise, so a JS-side implementation looks like it
does nothing at all.

Two things it must keep. **Every prototype is declared** — without `argtypes`,
ctypes marshals a Python int as a C `int`, so a 64-bit `HGLOBAL` is truncated, and
above 2^31 it raises `int too long to convert` rather than failing quietly. That
made every copy throw while the JS side saw only a call that returned nothing. And
**`OpenClipboard` is retried** — the clipboard is one global lock held by one
process at a time, so it fails transiently whenever a clipboard manager or another
app is touching it; without the retry, roughly a third of copies failed at random.

**Test the clipboard by reading it back.** Asserting that `copy_text` was *called*
proves nothing: the original bug threw inside it, after the call was recorded, and
a test built that way reported eleven successful copies while none had happened.

**`ui/app.js`** — `applyDefaults()` sets every control from code at startup.
WebView2 restores form state from its profile across launches, which silently
flipped un-premultiply off between runs. Do not rely on `checked` in the markup.

**`ui/select.js`** — an animated dropdown matching the rest of the interface,
without pulling in React for `@radix-ui/react-select`. Same behaviour and motion in
plain DOM. The real `<select>` stays in the document as the source of truth and
is visually hidden, so `$('format').value` and `onchange` keep working and nothing
else has to know the component exists.

Two things it cannot observe on its own: **setting `.value` from code fires no
change event and mutates no attribute**, so every programmatic write goes through
`setValue()` in app.js; and repopulating options is caught by a `MutationObserver`,
which is why `fillSelect` works without special handling.

**A disabled `<option>` has to be honoured by hand.** The native `<select>` is
visually hidden, so `option.disabled` has no visible effect on its own — the panel
is what the user sees, and it is built from scratch. Until v2.1 it rendered every
option as clickable, which is how "32-bit float" stayed pickable under PNG: the
value was set, the label said 32-bit, and `resolve_output` quietly wrote 16. Four
places need the check — `renderItems` (styling and no click handler), `commit`
(refuse), `nextEnabled`/`firstEnabled` (arrow keys, Home/End) and `doTypeahead`.
Disabled options are greyed rather than removed, and `option.title` is surfaced as
the tooltip, so the constraint explains itself.

Note the `MutationObserver` is a **microtask**: after changing `select.disabled`
from code, the trigger's own disabled state is not updated until the current script
finishes. Anything that toggles a select and then drives its panel in the same
synchronous block will act on the stale trigger.

**Preview sizing has two independent axes.** The column width is freeform
(`--preview-w`, dragged or jumped to by the S/M/L presets, persisted as
`preview_width`); the *render* resolution snaps to `RENDER_TIERS` and only changes
when a tier boundary is crossed. Keep them separate — tying the render to the
width re-renders on every pixel of a drag, and a render is tens of milliseconds.

**Scripts are plain, not ES modules.** The UI loads from a `file://` URL, whose
opaque origin makes `import` fail CORS. `select.js` must load before `app.js`.

**The shortcuts sheet is styled from `app.css`, in both windows.** `viewer.html`
loads `app.css` too, so `.vsheet` / `.keys` live there once rather than being
duplicated into `viewer.css` and drifting. Each window keeps its own markup and its
own key list — only the appearance is shared.

The converter has **one** sheet, behind the cogwheel: Windows integration and the
shortcuts side by side (`.sheet-cols`, `.vsheet-card.wide`). Stacked they made a
card taller than the window, which turns a reference list into a scroll. The `?`
key still opens it — the button went, not the shortcut, and that sheet is the only
place `?` is written down. The viewer keeps its own `?` button, since it has no
cogwheel to put one behind.

**The cogwheel must not be hidden with the integration toggles.** It is the only
button that opens the shortcuts, so off Windows `#integration-section` hides and
the gear stays; the grid then renders one column on its own.

**Testing UI keys: drive the real window, do not re-`eval` `app.js` in a browser.**
`const` declarations inside an `eval` are scoped to that eval, so an eval'd copy
gets its own `state` object; anything gated on `state.converting` then tests
nothing, and every eval stacks another `keydown` listener so handlers appear to
fire two and three times. `webview.start(func, window)` with `evaluate_js` gives a
single correctly-wired page — that is how the shortcut behaviour is verified.

## Running and building

```bash
pip install OpenImageIO OpenColorIO pywebview
python exr2srgb.py
pytest -q
```

`EXR2SRGB_DEBUG=1` opens devtools.

On the Mac the system Python is 3.9, too old for the wheels: use the repo's
`.venv` (Python 3.12, made by `uv`, Dropbox-ignored), i.e.
`.venv/bin/python exr2srgb.py` and `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q`.
`./build_mac.sh` makes it if it is missing. See [macOS](#macos).

`build_exe.bat` runs `EXRtoSRGB.spec`. Three things in that spec are load-bearing:
`collect_all` for OpenImageIO and PyOpenColorIO (the DLLs, without which the exe
builds fine and dies at launch), `datas=[('ui','ui')]` (the interface itself,
resolved through `sys._MEIPASS`), and pywebview's own hooks under
`webview/__pyinstaller` which PyInstaller discovers automatically.

The ACES configs are compiled into OpenColorIO, so nothing ships alongside the exe.
The web UI costs about 2 MB over the old tkinter build because WebView2 belongs to
the OS — there is no bundled browser.

## Verifying a colour change

`pytest -q` asserts all of this; run it before and after anything touching the
transform chain. The ladder is also in the README as a user-facing table:

| ACEScg in | ACES 1.3 → sRGB 8-bit | ACES 2.0 → sRGB 8-bit |
|---|---|---|
| 0.18 | 91 | 89 |
| 1.0 | 207 | 180 |
| 4.0 | 244 | 229 |

If 1.0 lands on 255, the ACES curve is not being applied — most likely the view
resolved to a plain transfer function instead of the tone-mapped one.

`exrs_tests/` holds Blender Cycles and C4D Redshift renders alongside Nuke
conversions of the same frames; mean 8-bit error is 1.09 / 0.13 / 0.05 and the
tests assert those bounds.

Four defaults are deliberate. Two are colour-critical: **ACES 1.3 CG v2.2**,
because Blender/Octane/Redshift ACES setups are still on 1.x, and **un-premultiply
on**, because renders write associated alpha. Two are workflow choices made in
v2.0.1: **16-bit**, which keeps gradients intact for anything going back into a
comp, and **`_srgb` suffix on**, so an in-place convert never leaves a `.png`
beside its `.exr` with the same stem. All four live in `applyDefaults()` in
`ui/app.js` — not in the markup, for the WebView2 reason above.

**ACES 1.2 is not an OCIO built-in.** It predates the built-in registry and exists
only as a downloadable `config.ocio`, so it cannot be compiled in. That is what the
`Custom config.ocio…` entry is for; don't try to add ACES 1.2 to `ACES_CONFIGS`.

## The viewer window

`ui/viewer.html` is rendered for **both** entry points, so there is one thing to
get right: `EXRtoSRGB.exe --view <path>` (what the shell runs on a double-click)
and the converter's **⧉** button, which calls `open_viewer()` to make a second
pywebview window in the same process. A second window rather than a second
process because it opens immediately and shares nothing that would need syncing.

**Zoom and pan never touch Python.** They are CSS transforms on the `<img>`, so
they stay smooth at any image size. Only exposure, gamma, channel and layer ask
for pixels, and those come off `ViewerSession`. The render is done once at a
generous fixed resolution (1600px) and scaled by the browser; past 1:1 the CSS
switches to `image-rendering: pixelated`, because an image viewer should show the
pixels rather than invent smooth ones.

Zoom percentages are reported against the **source** resolution, not the render,
so "100%" means actual pixels of the original.

**Window geometry is computed, not left to pywebview.** It centres on whatever it
considers primary, which on a multi-monitor setup is not where the user is
looking. `primary_screen()` picks the display at the origin, `viewer_geometry()`
sizes the viewer to the image at up to 1:1 capped to the screen, and
`remember_geometry()` persists size and position **on a debounce after each move
or resize** rather than only on `closing` — that event does not fire when a
process is killed, which is exactly when losing the geometry is most annoying.

**A remembered rect is a suggestion, not an instruction.** `geometry_is_sane()`
gates both the read and the write, and both windows use it. Without it the app
reopens in the taskbar and nowhere on screen, which cannot be recovered from the
UI — a window you cannot see is a window you cannot drag back. Two sources, both
observed:

- **Minimising fires `moved(-32000, -32000)` and a collapsed `resized`.** Those
  were persisted like any other value. That is where the `{"w": 560, "h": 420}`
  in a real `prefs.json` came from, and why reopening landed off-screen or tiny.
- **A rect saved for a display that is no longer attached** stays in the file.

The obvious test — "negative coordinates are off-screen" — is **wrong**, and
wrong on the machine this was reported from: it stacks a second monitor above
the primary at `y = -1440`, so every valid position there is negative. The check
is intersection with a real display from `screen_rects()`, requiring a corner of
at least 120px rather than a sliver.

`remember_geometry` also **seeds its state from the stored value**. It used to
start empty each session, so a session that only ever resized wrote `{w, h}`
over a good `{x, y, w, h}` — which is how the file ended up with a size and no
position, silently re-centring every window afterwards.

**Icons live in two places, and both are the aperture.** `app.ico` is the
application - the aperture on its own; `exr.ico` is the `.exr` document icon -
the same aperture with an EXR label from 32px up.

They used to differ by design (a VISOR mark for the app, an aperture for the
file) so a document and the app opening it were distinguishable. That was
abandoned in 3.1.1 for a practical reason: **when nothing owns `.exr`, Explorer
draws files with the icon of the application that handles them**, not the
document icon. With the ProgID claim withdrawn - which is the correct state on a
machine where Photoshop owns the type, see above - every `.exr` showed the VISOR
mark. Making the app icon the aperture too means the file looks right whichever
icon Windows reaches for.

`app.ico` is generated from `exr.ico`: crop the aperture (a square off the top
of the blue bounding box - the label is the same blue and swallows a plain
bbox), redraw it centred on the tile at 168/256, emit all eight sizes. Below 32px `exr.ico` drops the label
and gives the aperture the whole tile, because the text is unreadable there.
Registry entries point at a **copy under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`**, never at `BASE_DIR`:
in a one-file build that is a temp directory which is deleted on exit, so the icon
would go blank the moment the app closes.

**`CONVERT_VERBS` is the single source for both convert menus** — the Explorer
right-click submenu and the viewer's Convert button, which fetches it through
`ViewerApi.convert_presets()`. An option that existed in one place but not the
other would be a puzzle with no visible cause, so add presets there and nowhere
else.

**Context-menu verbs go under `SystemFileAssociations\.exr`,** not our ProgID, so
they appear whatever application owns the file type. On Windows 11 they land under
"Show more options". The short menu takes **only** `IExplorerCommand` COM handlers
from a signed MSIX or sparse package declaring `windows.fileExplorerContextMenus` —
a native DLL plus a package plus a trusted certificate. No registry verb from any
application reaches it, which is why every unpackaged tool on the machine sits in
the same submenu. Do not spend time trying to get there with registry keys.

**Explorer caches icons separately from associations.** `SHChangeNotify` updates
the handler but routinely leaves the old icon in place, which looks identical to a
failed registration. `refresh_shell()` also runs `ie4uinit.exe -show` to rebuild
that cache. If an icon still looks wrong, suspect the cache before the code.

**The two integration toggles live in a sheet behind the ⚙ in the title bar**, not
in Output settings. Everything in that grid is per-job; these are set once and
change the machine, and crammed into the same field they wrapped badly. The gear
hides entirely when neither is supported, so there is no empty sheet off Windows.
`assoc`/`ctx` and their `-wrap` ids are unchanged, so the platform gating in
`applyDefaults`' caller still works.

**Registering `.exr` and becoming the default for `.exr` are different things,
and the app can only do the first.** Since Windows 8 the default handler is
`FileExts\.exr\UserChoice` - on Windows 11 also `UserChoiceLatest`, which nests
the ProgID one level deeper - and the `Hash` beside it is signed per user. It
cannot be forged, and a `UserChoice` written without a valid hash makes Windows
discard the association altogether. `set_association(True)` *deletes* it, which
is allowed, but deleting only helps when a UserChoice exists.

**With no UserChoice at all, `HKCU\Software\Classes\.exr` still does not make us
the default once another application owns the type machine-wide.** Measured on
this machine: `HKCU\Software\Classes\.exr` = our ProgID, `HKCR\.exr` = our ProgID,
no UserChoice anywhere - and `AssocQueryString(ASSOCSTR_EXECUTABLE, ".exr")`
returns `Photoshop.exe`. A control extension carrying nothing but the same HKCU
registration resolves to our exe, so the keys are well formed; `.exr` loses
because Photoshop registered it in HKLM. An `OpenWithList` MRU was ruled out by
experiment (it does not override), as was `RegisteredApplications` capabilities
(nothing claims `.exr` there).

So **the toggle could never have worked on a machine with Photoshop, After
Effects or another EXR viewer installed** - which is every machine this ships to.
It appeared to work in the past only when the user had picked the app by hand in
"Open with", because that is what writes a real UserChoice.

**But the cause was an incomplete registration, not a Windows policy.** Once
`OpenWithProgids`, `Capabilities`/`RegisteredApplications` and
`Applications\<exe>` were all present, the *same* `.exr` class default that had
been losing to Photoshop started winning, with no UserChoice anywhere. Measured
both ways on the same machine. Do not repeat the earlier conclusion that this
needs a UserChoice - it needs the full registration, and the UserChoice is only
the fallback when even that loses.

That is why `set_association` writes the claim, calls the shell, and
**withdraws it if the shell still names someone else**. A claim Explorer ignores
is strictly worse than none: Settings reads that key to decide what to display
as the current default, so it shows this app and greys out "Set default", and
the user cannot fix an association the app itself broke. Ground truth over a
rule about when the claim holds.

Two consequences the code now depends on:

- **`association_state` asks the shell, not the registry.** `effective_handler`
  calls `AssocQueryString`, the same resolution Explorer uses, and compares it to
  `_exe_path()`. Reading back the keys we just wrote is not a check - it agrees
  with itself no matter what Windows does, and that is exactly how a checkbox
  reads "on" while double-click opens Photoshop. `OpenWith.exe` is mapped to
  `None`: it means nothing owns the type, not that the chooser owns it.
- **`choose_default()` hands the user to the UI their Windows allows, and the
  two are not the same.** On Windows 10, `SHOpenWithDialog` with
  `OAIF_FORCE_REGISTRATION` shows "How do you want to open this?" and the click
  writes a valid UserChoice. **On Windows 11 that call no longer sets defaults**
  - it puts up a message box reading *"To change your default apps, go to
  Settings > Apps > Default apps"* and returns. Measured on build 26200, not
  assumed; the dialog is real (`Shell_Dialog` + `Shell_Dim` windows appear) and
  it is a dead end. So 11 gets `ms-settings:defaultapps?registeredAppUser=EXR to
  sRGB` instead. `_is_windows_11()` splits on build 22000.

  `SHOpenWithDialog` takes a *file*, not an extension, so `_sample_exr()` finds
  the bundled `sample_render.exr` and writes a 1x1 to `%TEMP%` if it is missing -
  no file, no dialog, and that failure looks identical to the bug.

- **Being registered is not the same as being choosable.** The Settings deep
  link lands on nothing unless the app has declared itself, so
  `set_association(True)` also writes `Capabilities` +
  `Software\RegisteredApplications`, `.exr\OpenWithProgids`, and
  `Applications\<exe>` with `FriendlyAppName` and `SupportedTypes`. Without the
  last one the chooser lists us as `EXRtoSRGB.exe`. Unregister removes all of
  it, or the app keeps a row in Default apps after uninstall.

  Watch out when running **from source**: `Applications\<exe>` keys are named
  after `sys.executable`, so `--register` from a checkout brands
  `Applications\python.exe` with our friendly name. `--unregister` from the same
  checkout takes it back off.

The installer runs `--choose-default` in its own `[Run]` step, not `runhidden`,
because it is a window; `Api.set_association` falls back to it when registration
alone leaves the shell naming someone else.

`--register` takes `assoc` / `context` to select one part. Until 3.1 both rode on
the installer's association task, so ticking only the right-click menu did
nothing and ticking only the association installed the menu too.

**The registration is repaired at startup.** The command records an absolute path
and the filename carries the version, so every upgrade leaves it aimed at a file
that is gone. `repair_association()` runs from `Api.association()`, rewrites the
command and icon when the recorded path is not the running one, and only ever
touches a registration that is already ours - it cannot take a file type from
another application. Without it the natural recovery is "Open with", which writes
a UserChoice and shows the *application* icon instead of the document one.

**File association is per-user, under `HKCU\Software\Classes`.** No elevation,
nothing changed for other accounts, and `SHChangeNotify` is called afterwards or
Explorer keeps the old icon and handler until the next sign-in. Unregistering
only clears `.exr` if it still points at our ProgID, so it cannot stomp on a
handler someone else set in the meantime. It is behind an explicit toggle by
design.

## Cryptomatte

`probe_cryptomattes` / `extract_matte` / `convert_mattes`. Verified against a real
Blender 5.2 render (2160², 80 channels, two crypto types); ten of that file's own
manifest hashes are known-answer tests, so our `murmur3_32` is checked against
another implementation rather than itself. One of them is non-ASCII on purpose —
object names come from the DCC and are arbitrary Unicode, which is also why
`matte_filename` sanitises and why the object list uses `textContent`.

Things real files do that synthetic ones do not:

- **A single rank's coverage can exceed 1.0** — the Blender file reached 2.633,
  because the pixel filter accumulates. The clamp in `extract_matte` is required,
  not defensive.
- **Mattes do not sum to 1.0.** Only 27% of pixels did in that render: rank count
  is capped by the render's Levels setting, so overlap beyond that is simply not
  in the file. The synthetic fixture does sum to 1.0 and asserts it; do not extend
  that assertion to real files.
- **Channel layers carry the view layer prefix** — `ViewLayer.CryptoObject00.r`,
  lowercase components, while the sibling AOVs use uppercase. `label` strips the
  prefix for display.

**`[hidden]` loses to any class that sets `display`.** The attribute only gets
`display: none` from the UA stylesheet, so `.settings` (grid) and `.crypto-body`
(flex) kept both tab bodies laid out at once — which is what put a scrollbar in
the left column. `app.css` sets `[hidden] { display: none !important }` for this.
`el.hidden` still reports `true` in that state, so the attribute is not evidence
the element is gone; check the computed height.

**ID planes must be subsampled, never filtered.** Averaging two IDs produces a
third that matches no object in the manifest, so `_subsample` takes nearest
neighbours. A test asserts the preview invents no IDs.

**OIIO's PNG writer always associates alpha.** Writing RGB 1.0 with a coverage
alpha reads back as RGB = coverage, and no `oiio:UnassociatedAlpha` or
`png:unassociatedAlpha` attribute changes it (measured). TIFF preserves it by
default — and *inverts* if that attribute is set. So `resolve_matte_output` forces
TIFF for `matte_mode="straight"` rather than writing a file that silently is not
what was asked for.

## Scene-linear output

`transfer="linear"` is a different job from everything else here: it moves data
rather than making a picture. Three things it must never do — all asserted in
`tests/test_core.py`:

- **Clamp.** Linear values run past 1.0 and that is the point. Only the display
  path clips.
- **Touch alpha.** Un-premultiply is skipped entirely, so the toggle has no effect
  and the output is bit-identical to the source layer.
- **Claim to be sRGB.** The file is tagged `colorspace=Linear` and named `_linear`.
  TIFF can only express sRGB natively — via the EXIF ColorSpace tag — and OIIO
  silently *drops* an unrecognised "Linear", so it also goes in `ImageDescription`,
  which always survives. A linear file labelled sRGB gets a transfer function
  applied twice downstream, which is the same class of bug as the two below.

The preview stays display-referred in this mode (raw linear renders as a near-black
smear) and returns `preview_only=True` so the UI can say so.

## Two invariants that have already been violated once

**Cryptomatte is read from whichever part carries the metadata**, not from part
0. The channel indices in `ranks` only mean anything against that part's channel
list, so `read_crypto_ranks` takes the subimage too — reading them from part 0
would return whatever happened to sit at those positions.

**Never match EXR channels on the component suffix alone.** Channels are
`<layer>.<component>`, so a Blender AOV dump contains fifteen channels ending in
`R`. The pre-1.1 code took the first one, which — because Blender writes layers
alphabetically — was reliably `Ambient_Occlusion`. The tool exported the AO pass as
the beauty for its entire v1.0 lifetime, and the output looked plausible enough
that nobody caught it. Group into layers, then choose by `score_layer`.

Note `_DATA_LAYER_EXACT` alongside the substring list: Redshift writes normals as
bare `N` and depth as `Z`, which no substring rule can catch without also
condemning every layer containing an n or a z.

**Un-premultiply and re-premultiply must stay paired *inside* the pipeline.**
Dividing alpha out before the display transform is what lets the transfer
function see true surface colour; putting it back afterwards is what `compose`'s
flatten modes rely on, since compositing associated data over black is just
dropping alpha. The `unpremulted` flag in `apply_transform` keeps that pair
honest. Breaking either half puts a bright fringe on antialiased edges.

**What reaches the file is a separate decision, and it was not being made.**
`write_image` never told OIIO what it was handing over, and the PNG writer
assumes associated alpha and divides it back out — PNG is unassociated by spec.
So the re-premultiply was undone at the last step: the file came out straight
whichever way the un-premultiply setting pointed, and turning it *off* stored
`f(c)/α`, which is neither convention and further from every other tool. The fix
is `oiio:UnassociatedAlpha` on the output spec, **PNG only** — TIFF already
stores what it is given and *inverts* if that attribute is set, which is what
`resolve_matte_output` depends on for straight coverage mattes.

**The two conventions, both legitimate**, traced on a 4000px production render
against Nuke and After Effects. Opaque pixels agreed to **2/65535** and alpha to
**1/65535** — the colour pipeline was never in question. Only antialiased edges
differed, by up to **28/255** on 0.21% of pixels:

| Alpha setting | `unpremult` | stored RGB | who else writes this |
|---|---|---|---|
| Keep — straight (**default**) | `True` | `f(c/α)` — true surface colour, straight alpha | PNG's own spec; correct over a new background |
| Keep — match Nuke/AE | `False` | `f(c)` — transform applied to the premultiplied value | **Nuke and After Effects, bit-exactly** |

**Straight is the default again as of 3.2.5**, at the owner's request after real
use: laying a render with alpha over a background plate in Photoshop, the
straight file's edges came out cleaner. Matching Nuke/AE stays one pick away for
anyone diffing against a compositor export. The default lives in **three**
places that must move together - `applyDefaults()` in `ui/app.js`,
`convert_cli()` in `exr2srgb.py` (the right-click verbs *and* the viewer's
Convert button) and `--alpha` in `cli.py` - and `tests/test_convert_routes.py`
guards the first two.

**The choice lives in the Alpha dropdown, not a checkbox.** It used to be a
separate "Un-premultiply" tickbox sitting beside an Alpha select that already
decided keep/flatten — two controls for one question, and the tickbox's label
said nothing about which tool it matched. `gather()` in `ui/app.js` and `cli.py`
both split the one UI value back into `alpha_mode` + `unpremult`, so `core`'s
contract is unchanged. Flatten modes keep `unpremult=True`, which is the
colour-correct way to composite over a background. `applyPreset` maps a
pre-3.1.2 preset (`alpha_mode="keep"` + `unpremult=True`) onto `keep_straight`,
or applying an old preset would silently change the convention it was saved with.

Note `f(c) ≠ α·f(c/α)`: the transform is non-linear, so "off" is not a missing
re-premultiply and must not be re-derived as one. That conflation is what made
the difference look like a premultiply bug for the whole of v3.
`tests/test_core.py::test_alpha_convention_written_to_disk` reads the stored
bytes rather than the associated read-back, which is the only way to see any of
this — OIIO re-associates on the way in and hides it.

## Updating in place

`download_update` / `install_update` / `Api.install_update`. This is the only
path that ends in **running an executable**, so the checks around it are the
feature, not decoration:

- The URL must start with `ASSET_PREFIX` - https, this repository, the
  `releases/download/` path. Checked before any request is made.
- The length must match the `size` the API reported.
- The SHA-256 must match the `digest` the API published (GitHub returns
  `"sha256:<hex>"`). Verified against the local build: they agree exactly.

**A failed check deletes the partial file.** A half-written installer left in
`%TEMP%` is precisely what a later run would find and trust.

`Api.install_update` re-checks rather than trusting the blob the front end is
holding - that result may be minutes old, and this one ends in execution.

**The app must be gone before setup can replace it, and the installer is what
guarantees that - not the app.** `install_update` starts the installer detached
and a daemon thread calls `os._exit(0)` after ~1.2s, long enough for the UI to
say what is happening before the window goes. That 1.2s is a courtesy, **not the
mechanism**: it is a race, and it loses. A user updating 3.2.4 -> 3.2.5 got
*"DeleteFile failed; code 5. Access is denied."* on `{app}\EXRtoSRGB.exe`,
reproduced here on the first try.

`installer.iss` carries **`CloseApplications=force`** for this, and it is
load-bearing. Inno's default (`yes`) asks Restart Manager to shut the app down
*gracefully*, which a pywebview window never answers - the setup log shows
`RmGetList` finding both processes, then `Shutting down applications using our
files`, then nothing, then the failed delete. `force` terminates them instead.
`RestartApplications=no` goes with it, so setup does not bring the app back up
behind the user's back.

Two things make the race worse than it looks. The one-file build is **two
processes** - the PyInstaller bootloader and its child - and `os._exit(0)` only
ends the child; the bootloader then lingers deleting its 37 MB `_MEI` scratch
directory, still holding the exe. So the window where the file is locked extends
well past the app's own exit.

Measured on the rebuilt installer: `Shutting down applications using our files.
(forced)`, then every file installed, no error. Note the forced shutdown took
**31s** against an app that was ignoring it completely - that is the worst case,
and the real update path is much quicker because `install_update` has already
exited the app by then. Setup shows its progress window throughout.

**The prompt afterwards had to be gated too.** With the replace now succeeding,
Setup reached the `--choose-default` `[Run]` entry, which is `waituntilterminated`
and opens a window - the Default apps page on Windows 11. In a silent in-app
update that is Settings appearing unasked, with Setup stalled behind it until it
is dismissed. It now carries `Check: not WizardSilent`, so an interactive install
still offers it and an update does not. Nobody hit this before 3.2.6 only because
the install failed earlier.

**The fix ships in the installer being run, so it self-heals forward**: someone
on 3.2.5 who clicks update downloads the 3.2.6 installer, which force-closes.
Anyone already staring at that dialog can close the app and press **Try again**,
or take the installer from the release page.

The installer runs `/SILENT`, which still shows a progress window: something has
to be on screen while the app it is replacing disappears. Per-user install, so no
elevation prompt.

Note the updater only reaches users who **already have a build containing it**.
Anyone older still has to take the release-page link once.

## macOS

Added 2026-10-16. The research before building it: nothing on macOS does this
whole job. DJV and mrv2 view EXR through OCIO but are players, not batch
converters with layer scoring; tev has no OCIO; `oiiotool --ociodisplay` is the
transform without any of the layer, alpha or cryptomatte handling; the Mac
EXR converters found (Sequency, UniConverter) are video-first or gamma-only.
So it is a port of this app, not a new one.

**One codebase.** `core.py`, `cli.py` and `ui/` are unchanged in behaviour;
`exr2srgb.py` branches on `IS_MAC` and everything macOS-specific lives in
`macos.py`, imported only on darwin, so no Windows code path changed. The
`os.name != "nt"` guards that already existed made most of this a matter of
filling in the other branch.

| Windows | macOS |
|---|---|
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EXRtoSRGB` | `~/Library/Application Support/EXRtoSRGB` |
| Win32 clipboard via ctypes | `NSPasteboard` |
| `explorer /select,` | `open -R` |
| `MessageBoxW` | `osascript display alert` |
| ProgID + UserChoice | Launch Services `setDefaultApplicationAtURL:` |
| Explorer verb submenu | a Quick Action in `~/Library/Services` |
| one process per double-click | `application:openFiles:` into the running app |
| Inno Setup installer + updater | `.dmg`; the update button opens the release page |

**Double-click is an Apple Event, not argv.** Launch Services never starts a
second process: it sends the file to the running one. So `--view` only covers a
cold launch (PyInstaller's `argv_emulation=True` turns the launch event into
argv), and every later double-click arrives at `application:openFiles:`, which
opens a viewer in-process. Clicking the Dock icon of an app showing only viewers
arrives at `applicationShouldHandleReopen:` and must bring the converter up -
`open_converter()` is idempotent for that reason. pywebview's `AppDelegate`
implements neither, so `install_app_events` adds them as a pyobjc **category**,
which must be named `AppDelegate` (pyobjc refuses any other name). The handlers
spawn a thread: creating a pywebview window inside an AppKit callback waits on
the run loop it is blocking. All three paths verified against the built bundle:
cold launch, cold launch from a file, file into a running app, reopen.

**The default-app API prompts, every time.** On macOS 27
`setDefaultApplicationAtURL:toOpenContentType:` puts up a system confirmation
and its completion handler waits for the answer - an accepted change took 18.6s
in testing, which is a person reading a dialog. A "no" comes back as
`NSCocoaErrorDomain 256 "The file couldn't be opened"` wrapping
`userCanceledErr (-128)`, which reads like a failure. `macos._declined` digs
it out and raises `Declined`, and the toggle reports "nothing changed" and
settles on what Launch Services actually says. Handing the type back is a
change too and prompts as well. **Do not test this casually**: each call puts a
dialog in front of the user, and a declined restore leaves `.exr` with a dev
build in `dist/`.

Only a bundle can be a default handler, so from a checkout the toggle is hidden
(`bundle_path()` is None) - the macOS form of the `Applications\python.exe`
trap. The Quick Action works from a checkout, since it just runs a command.

**`.exr` is `com.ilm.openexr-image`**, declared by macOS. The bundle claims it
in `CFBundleDocumentTypes` with `LSHandlerRank` **Alternate** - listed under
Open With, never the default unless the user ticks the toggle. `Owner` would
let Launch Services hand us `.exr` at install, the silent takeover the Windows
build refuses too.

**One Quick Action with a chooser, not five.** Finder cannot nest Quick
Actions. `convert_menu` asks with `choose from list` (built from
`CONVERT_VERBS`, still the single source), converts the whole selection
through `core.convert_many`, and posts a notification. Finder hands over the
selection at once, so a sequence is one process. `NSRequiredContext` (Finder)
and `NSSendFileTypes` (the EXR UTI) keep it out of every other file's menu.
The workflow records an absolute path, so `Api.context_menu()` repairs it at
startup like `repair_association()`. Strings reach AppleScript as **argv**,
never spliced into source - filenames are arbitrary Unicode. Verified with
`automator -i <file> <workflow>`, which runs it the way Finder does.

**Coordinates are screen-local on macOS.** The Cocoa backend positions windows
relative to `NSScreen.mainScreen()` with y flipped to count from the top, and
reports positions back the same way, so `screen_rects()` on a Mac is that one
screen. `webview.screens` gives global, bottom-up frames and must not be
compared against.

**Ctrl-click is a right-click on a Mac.** The handlers already accepted
`metaKey`; `applyPlatform()` in `app.js` rewrites `.mod` / `.alt` spans to ⌘ /
⌥, and `html[data-os]` picks the `.only-win` / `.only-mac` wording. Before
init the Windows text shows, which is what every build did before.

**Building.** `./build_mac.sh` → `dist/EXR to sRGB.app` + `dist/EXRtoSRGB_v<ver>_macOS_<arch>.dmg`.
onedir + `BUNDLE`, not onefile, and no UPX (it breaks signatures). The bundle
is re-signed ad hoc as a whole after PyInstaller, or Apple Silicon calls it
damaged; it is **not notarised**, so a downloaded copy needs right-click → Open
once. The build is the host's architecture only - OpenImageIO's wheels are per
arch - so an Intel build needs an Intel Mac. `--diag` is the smoke test at the
end of the script: it imports the whole frozen app headless. A frozen convert
was checked bit-identical to a source one.

`dist/` and `.venv/` are created with `com.dropbox.ignored` set before anything
is written into them, per the root CLAUDE.md - a 74 MB bundle of dylibs has no
business syncing to the Windows machine.

`make_icns.py` rebuilds `app.icns` from `app.ico`, whose largest frame is 256px.
The aperture is upscaled as a coverage *mask* and re-thresholded on a 4x canvas,
then intersected with a drawn circle - cropping at the half-coverage bbox
shaved the rim flat on four sides. The tile is redrawn on Apple's grid (824 on
1024, with a shadow), not run to the edge.

## Installing

`installer.iss` (Inno Setup) + `build_installer.py`. Build with
`python build_installer.py` after `build_exe.bat`; the Python wrapper exists
because reading VERSION and locating ISCC in cmd is how the last build script
broke - a Python one-liner inside a `for /f` dies on its own parentheses.

**The installer compiles into `%TEMP%` and is moved in afterwards.** Inno writes
the setup program and then patches its resources in place, and since the repo
moved into Dropbox the sync client grabs the new 45 MB file mid-write and holds
it - so the patch dies with *"Resource update error: EndUpdateResource failed,
try excluding the Output folder from your antivirus software (110)"*. It is
reproducible on every run and **it is not antivirus**; do not go looking for a
Defender exclusion. Same reason `build_exe.bat` sends PyInstaller's scratch there.

**Per-user, `PrivilegesRequired=lowest`.** Everything the app registers lives in
`HKCU`, so a machine-wide install would need elevation to place files and then
have to drop back to the signed-in user to register anything. `%LOCALAPPDATA%
\Programs\EXRtoSRGB` means no UAC at all, and it still appears in Add/Remove
Programs.

**The installed exe has a stable name at a fixed path.** Windows records that path
in the association, so a versioned filename broke the double-click on every
upgrade - which is exactly what 3.0.4 did. The version lives in the installer's
filename, the uninstall entry and the file properties.

**The installer calls `EXRtoSRGB.exe --register`** rather than writing the keys
itself, so there is one implementation instead of a second copy in Pascal that
drifts. `--unregister` runs from `[UninstallRun]` *before* the exe is deleted -
afterwards there is nothing left to run. Neither is elevated, so both land in the
right hive.

**Never edit a source file through PowerShell `Get-Content | Set-Content`.**
PowerShell 5.1's `Get-Content` reads a BOM-less file as **ANSI (cp1252)**, so
every UTF-8 character is mis-decoded and written straight back corrupted - and
`Set-Content -Encoding utf8` then adds a BOM, which makes the *next* such edit
look clean. Bumping `VERSION` that way turned `EXR → sRGB` into `EXR â†' sRGB`
in the window title, the `·` in five right-click menu labels, and eleven other
strings, and it shipped in 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 before anyone saw the title bar.
Repair is `text.encode('cp1252').decode('utf-8')`, once - the second pass reads
the BOM and is a no-op. Use the editing tools, which do not re-encode.

**`APP_NAME` is the window title, `FRIENDLY_NAME` is what the registry shows.**
They are different strings on purpose - the title has the arrow, the registry
name is plain ASCII because Settings and the "Open with" chooser read it back.
Defining a second `APP_NAME` for the registration shadowed the first and quietly
renamed the app in the title bar and taskbar.

**Beware testing registry writes from a sandboxed shell.** The Bash tool and
PowerShell here see *different* HKCU views: writes made through one are invisible
to the other. That produced a long false trail - the association appearing not to
save, verbs appearing stale, the Add/Remove entry appearing absent - none of which
was real. Verify shell integration through PowerShell, or from the app itself with
`--diag`.

**`--diag`** prints what the app thinks it is: frozen or not, its own path, the
command it would register, and what is actually in the registry. Worth reaching for
first, because every shell-integration bug looks identical from outside.

## Release

**The exe carries its version in the filename** — `EXRtoSRGB_v3.0.4.exe`. The spec
reads `VERSION` out of `exr2srgb.py`, so there is one place to change it, and
`.gitignore` matches `/EXRtoSRGB*.exe` because an exact rule would start letting
old builds through. `build_exe.bat` deliberately does **not** work the name out for
itself: doing that in cmd needs a Python one-liner inside a `for /f`, and the
parentheses in it break cmd's parser — it discovers the built file afterwards
instead.

Two consequences worth knowing. GitHub's `/releases/latest/download/<name>` needs an
exact filename, so the README's download button points at the **latest-release page**
rather than at the asset; a fixed link would break on every version. And the file
association records the full path of the exe that registered it, so **upgrading to a
new filename leaves the old association pointing at a file that is gone** — the
double-click and the right-click verbs need re-toggling under the cogwheel after an
upgrade. That is the cost of the versioned name.

`EXRtoSRGB_v<version>.exe` (~37.7 MB) ships as a GitHub Release asset and is gitignored.
`build_exe.bat` writes it to the **repo root** rather than `dist/`, so the folder
shows the app; PyInstaller's scratch goes to `%TEMP%`.

`dist/EXRtoPNG.exe` (35.7 MB) is the superseded v1.0.0 asset, kept locally for
re-upload — safe to delete, since it is already published on Releases. Its name
is deliberately *not* updated: it is the old tkinter binary and `EXRtoPNG.exe` is
what that release actually shipped. Never commit either binary.
