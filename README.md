Colour is done with **OpenColorIO's built-in ACES configs** — the same engine your
renderer uses — so the output matches your viewport instead of a gamma guess. The
ACES output transform (RRT + ODT) is applied properly, not approximated.

Tested against **Blender Cycles**, **C4D Redshift** and **C4D Octane** output, and
checked frame-for-frame against Nuke conversions of the same renders.

---

## Highlights

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Correct ACES colour** | Eight ACES configs compiled in, 1.3 and 2.0, CG and Studio. No config files to ship. |
| **Batch, in parallel** | Whole folders at once across a thread pool — **5× faster** than one at a time on a 16-frame run. |
| **A real `.exr` viewer** | Double-click any EXR. Zoom, pan, exposure, gamma, channel isolation, layer switching, pixel probe. |
| **A/B compare** | Load a second render and wipe, flip, or view the difference in linear. |
| **Cryptomatte** | Read the manifest, click objects straight off the image, export mattes. |
| **Multi-part EXR** | Every part of a File Output node's export shows up as a layer. |
| **Sequences** | Drop one frame, get the run. Step through frames next to the preview. |
| **Right-click convert** | Five presets in Explorer, or a Quick Action in Finder. No window opened. |
| **Windows and macOS** | The same app on both, down to the colour pipeline and the test suite. |
| **Command line** | `--cli` for a farm, a build step, or a shell loop. |
| **Tells you about updates** | Checks GitHub on launch and shows a pill in the title bar when there's a newer release. |

## Install

### Windows — [⬇ download the latest release](../../releases/latest)

Run `EXRtoSRGB_Setup_v<version>.exe`. It installs like any other application:

- **No admin prompt.** Installs per-user to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\EXRtoSRGB`,
  the same as VS Code or Discord. Nothing is changed for other accounts.
- **Appears in Add/Remove Programs**, with a Start menu entry and a working
  uninstaller that takes the file association and right-click menu with it.
- **Offers to open `.exr` files** and to add the right-click convert menu, both
  ticked by default and both changeable later under the **⚙**. If another
  application already owns `.exr`, setup opens the page where you can hand it
  over — Settings → Default apps on Windows 11, the "Open with" chooser on
  Windows 10. Only you can set a default file handler on Windows; an installer
  cannot do it silently, whatever it claims.
- **Upgrades in place.** The app lives at a fixed path, so the association keeps
  working across versions.

The app itself is self-contained — OpenImageIO, OpenColorIO and every ACES config
are compiled in. Windows supplies the webview, so there's no bundled browser.

> The installer is unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen shows a warning the first time.
> **More info → Run anyway.** Code signing is a paid annual certificate rather than
> anything that can be fixed in the source.

### macOS — [⬇ download v3.3.0](../../releases/tag/v3.3.0)

Open `EXRtoSRGB_v<version>_macOS_arm64.dmg` and drag **EXR to sRGB** into
Applications. Same app: the converter, the viewer, cryptomatte and the command
line are the same code, and the test suite — the ACES ladder included — passes
on both.

- **Apple Silicon.** The build is per architecture, because OpenImageIO's
  wheels are. An Intel Mac needs its own build — run `./build_mac.sh` on one.
- **Double-click opens the viewer** once you tick *Open .exr files with this
  viewer* under the **⚙**. macOS asks you to confirm the change, and unticking
  hands `.exr` back to whatever had it, usually Preview. *Open With* lists the
  app either way.
- **Right-click → Quick Actions → Convert to sRGB…** — see
  [below](#right-click--convert-to-srgb).
- **Updates** link to the release page; the in-place updater is Windows-only.

> The app is signed ad hoc, not notarised, so the first launch of a downloaded
> copy needs **right-click → Open → Open**. Notarisation needs a paid Apple
> Developer account. A copy you build yourself opens normally.

There's a sample render in [`docs/sample_render.exr`](docs/sample_render.exr) if you
want something to drop on it straight away — the frame in the screenshots above.
Scene-linear ACEScg, 1600 × 1000, with highlights up past 10.0, so it actually
shows the ACES roll-off rather than looking the same through any curve.

<details>
<summary>Run from source instead</summary>

```bash
pip install OpenImageIO OpenColorIO pywebview
python exr2srgb.py
```

`EXR2SRGB_DEBUG=1` opens devtools. Tests are `pip install pytest && pytest -q`.
On a Mac the system Python is too old for the wheels — use Python 3.12 or later
in a venv.

## Converting

Drag `.exr` files or folders anywhere onto the window, or use **Add files** /
**Add folder**. Whatever you just added is selected automatically.

**Sequences collapse into one row.** A folder of `shot_010.0001.exr … .0240.exr`
reads as `shot_010.####.exr · 240 frames · 1–240`. Drop a *single* frame and the
whole run comes with it — matching stem, frame padding *and* extension, so a
differently padded render or a stray `.png` never joins by accident.

Only one converter window opens at a time; launching again focuses it. Viewers are
unrestricted.

### Output

| | |
|---|---|
| **PNG** | 8 or 16-bit. 16 is the default — gradients survive a trip back into a comp. |
| **JPEG** | 8-bit, quality selectable, no alpha. |
| **TIFF** | 8, 16, or 32-bit float. |
| **Scene-linear TIFF** | 32-bit float, no display transform, no clamp. See [below](#scene-linear-output). |

The `_srgb` suffix is on by default, so converting in place never drops a `.png`
next to its `.exr` with the same stem.

**The Alpha setting picks the edge-pixel convention**, and the two "keep" entries
are both correct — they answer different questions. Nothing but antialiased edges
changes; opaque pixels are identical either way.

| Alpha | What lands in the file | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| **Keep alpha — straight** (default) | True surface colour, alpha stored alongside — what PNG's spec asks for | The image will be composited over a new background, e.g. in Photoshop |
| **Keep alpha — match Nuke / After Effects** | The display transform applied to the premultiplied value | You want the file to match what your compositor exports |
| **Flatten on black / white** | No alpha channel; composited over that colour | You need a flat RGB deliverable |

If you are diffing this tool's output against a Nuke or After Effects export and
finding edges a few levels apart, that setting is the reason — switch to
**match Nuke / After Effects** and it matches both **to the bit**, measured on a
4000px production render.

On the CLI: `--alpha keep-straight` (default), `keep`, `black`, `white`.

### Presets

Save the combination you actually use — config, display, format, depth — and pick
it next launch. Presets deliberately don't store the output folder: a preset is
*how* to convert, not *where* to put it.

### Every layer at once

Tick **Convert every layer, one file each** and a multi-AOV render writes one image
per layer in a single pass, each named for its layer.

---

## Layers, AOVs and multi-part files

Multi-layer EXRs name channels `<layer>.<component>`. The beauty is auto-detected
by ranking layer *names* — never by matching the component suffix, which is how a
tool ends up exporting Ambient Occlusion as the beauty and nobody notices.

Data layers — normals, position, depth, motion vectors, cryptomatte — are excluded
from auto-detection, since running them through a view transform is meaningless.
You can still select them explicitly.

**Multi-part EXRs work.** Blender's **File Output** node writes one *part* per slot
rather than one channel group per pass, so a custom AOV export is a multi-part file
by construction. Every part is listed as a layer, the beauty is still auto-detected
across all of them, and cryptomatte is read from whichever part carries it.

---

## Colour

### Settings

**OCIO configuration** — eight ACES configs are compiled in:

| | CG | Studio |
|---|---|---|
| **ACES 1.3** | v1.0, v2.1, v2.2 *(default)* | v1.0, v2.1, v2.2 |
| **ACES 2.0** | v4.0 | v4.0 |

Default is **ACES 1.3 · CG v2.2**, which matches the output transform in current
Blender, Octane and Redshift ACES setups. ACES 2.0 is a different look, not a newer
version of the same one — the tone curve genuinely changed.

**ACES 1.2 is not a built-in.** It predates OCIO's built-in registry and only exists
as a downloadable `config.ocio`. Use **Custom config.ocio…** and point at it.

### Matching this in Nuke

Worth getting right, because the wrong pick silently skips the ACES curve.

**With an ACES 1.3 CG/Studio config** (`fn-nuke_cg-config-v2.2.0_aces-v1.3_ocio-v2.4`
and friends), the output transform is a **display + view** pair, not a colorspace:

| Write node | Set to |
|---|---|
| transform type | `display` |
| display | `sRGB - Display` |
| view | `ACES 1.0 - SDR Video` |

> **Don't** pick the colorspace `sRGB Encoded Rec.709 (sRGB)`. It's a plain transfer
> function — identical to the *Un-tone-mapped* view — and highlights clip instead of
> rolling off. The give-away is the ladder below: 1.0 lands on **255** instead of 207.

**With an ACES 1.2 `config.ocio`**, `color_picking (Output - sRGB)` *is* the full
RRT + ODT, so that setting is correct as-is.

**Tick `premultiplied` on the Write node.** Renders carry associated alpha; without
it the display transform is applied to already-premultiplied pixels and antialiased
edges come out with a dark fringe.

### Matching this in After Effects

Use the **ACES 1.3 · CG v1.0** or **Studio v1.0** entry — those are the config
versions After Effects ships with.

### Sanity check

These are correct ACES values. If **1.0 lands on 255**, the ACES curve isn't being
applied — the view has resolved to a plain transfer function.

| ACEScg in | ACES 1.3 → sRGB 8-bit | ACES 2.0 → sRGB 8-bit |
|---|---|---|
| 0.18 | 91 | 89 |
| 1.0 | 207 | 180 |
| 4.0 | 244 | 229 |

### Verified against Nuke

Blender Cycles and C4D Redshift renders, converted here and in Nuke, compared
pixel-for-pixel. Mean 8-bit error:

| Source | Mean error |
|---|---|
| Blender Cycles beauty | **1.09** |
| C4D Redshift beauty | **0.13** |
| Redshift, alpha | **0.05** |

The test suite asserts those bounds, so a colour regression fails the build rather
than shipping.

## Viewer

**Double-click any `.exr` and it opens.** The installer offers this, or tick
**Open .exr files with this viewer** under the **⚙** in the title bar. The
association is per-user, needs no admin rights, and unticking hands the file type
back.

`.exr` files also get their own aperture icon, distinct from the app's, so a file and
the app that opens it don't look identical in Explorer.

> **If Photoshop, After Effects or another viewer already owns `.exr`,** ticking
> the toggle usually still wins it — but Windows has the final say, and where it
> refuses, only you can override it. In that case the toggle opens the right page
> for your Windows:
>
> - **Windows 11** — Settings → Apps → Default apps, at the **EXR → sRGB** entry.
>   Set `.exr` there. (Windows 11 removed the ability for apps to show the old
>   one-click chooser; it now answers with a message pointing at Settings.)
> - **Windows 10** — the **"How do you want to open this?"** dialog. Pick
>   **EXR → sRGB**.
>
> The toggle reports what Windows actually resolves `.exr` to, not what the app
> asked for — so if it reads off after you ticked it, the default really is
> somewhere else.

The window opens **centred and sized to the image**, up to 1:1, capped to your screen.
Move or resize it and that's remembered.

- **Zoom and pan** — scroll to zoom at the cursor, drag to pan. `F` fits, `1` is actual
  pixels. Past 1:1 the visible region is re-rendered at **source resolution**, so 100%
  means real pixels rather than an upscaled preview.
- **Exposure and gamma** — exposure in stops *before* the display transform, so it
  behaves like a camera stop; gamma after, like a compositor's viewer gamma.
- **Channel isolation** — `R` `G` `B` `A`, `C` back to colour.
- **Layer switching** for multi-layer and multi-part files.
- **Pixel probe** — linear scene values, plus a colour chip and the hex of what's on
  screen. Every value copies on click. The **eyedropper** (`E`) locks one reading so
  it stops following the cursor.
- **Convert** — the same presets as the right-click menu, applied to the layer you're
  looking at.

### A/B compare

Load a second EXR with **Compare…** and flip between them, wipe, or look at the
difference. `\` cycles the four modes.

The difference is taken **in linear**, before the tone curve — a difference of 0.01
then means the same thing in the shadows as in the highlights, and exposure works as
the gain control for reading small ones. The two images must be the same size; a
resized comparison would partly be measuring the resampler.

---

## Cryptomatte

Read the cryptomatte manifest, pick objects, export mattes.

**Pick straight off the ID view: `Ctrl`-click adds, `Alt`-click removes.** Ticked
objects stay lit and everything else dims, so the selection builds up on the image
instead of being hunted through a list.

- **Type** — `CryptoObject`, `CryptoMaterial`, and whatever else the renderer wrote.
  Selections are remembered per type.
- **Filter** a long list; **Select all** acts on what the filter shows.
- **One file per object** or **combine into one**.
- **White silhouette (premultiplied)** or **flat white RGB**. The second forces TIFF,
  because PNG always associates alpha and would turn flat white back into coverage.

---

## Right-click → Convert to sRGB

Enable it under the **⚙** to add a convert submenu to `.exr` files in Explorer:
PNG 8/16-bit, JPEG, TIFF 16-bit, and TIFF 32-bit scene-linear. Conversion runs
headless — no window ever opens. It's [pictured at the top](#exr--srgb).

The verbs are registered under `SystemFileAssociations\.exr`, so they show up
whatever application owns the file type, and `.exr` files get their own aperture
icon once the association is on.

**On a Mac** it's a Quick Action: right-click any `.exr` in Finder → **Quick
Actions → Convert to sRGB…**, pick a preset from the same list, and the whole
selection converts — a 240-frame sequence is one job, not 240. A notification
says when it's done. Finder can't nest Quick Actions, which is why it's one
entry with a chooser rather than five. It lives in `~/Library/Services` and
unticking the toggle deletes it.

<details>
<summary>Why it's under "Show more options" on Windows 11</summary>

Windows 11's short menu only accepts `IExplorerCommand` COM handlers from a signed
MSIX or sparse package. That means a native DLL, a package, and a trusted
certificate — no registry verb from any application can reach it, which is why every
unpackaged tool sits in the same submenu.

</details>

---

## Scene-linear output

Set **Look** to *Scene-linear* and the file is data rather than a picture: no display
transform, no clamp, alpha untouched, and 32-bit float TIFF regardless of what else
is selected.

Three things it deliberately does **not** do:

- **Clamp.** Linear values run past 1.0 and that's the point.
- **Touch alpha.** Un-premultiply is skipped, so the output is bit-identical to the
  source layer.
- **Claim to be sRGB.** The file is tagged `colorspace=Linear`, written to
  `ImageDescription` as well as the EXIF tag because TIFF can only express sRGB
  natively and OIIO silently drops an unrecognised value. A linear file labelled sRGB
  gets a transfer function applied twice downstream.

The preview stays display-referred in this mode and says so — raw linear renders as a
near-black smear.

---

## Command line

```bash
EXRtoSRGB.exe --cli shots/ --format png --bits 16 --out out/
```

| Flag | |
|---|---|
| `--out DIR` | output folder (default: beside each source) |
| `--format` `--bits` `--quality` | container and depth |
| `--config NAME` | built-in name, a substring of one, or a path to `config.ocio` |
| `--display` `--input-cs` `--look` | colour; `--look linear` for scene-linear |
| `--layer NAME` `--all-layers` | one layer, or every layer as its own file |
| `--jobs N` | worker threads (default automatic, capped at 8) |
| `--dry-run` | print what would be written and stop |
| `--list-configs` `--list-displays` `--list-layers` | inspect and exit |

Exit codes: **0** fine, **1** some frames failed, **2** nothing to convert, **3** bad
arguments. `--config` refuses an ambiguous match rather than guessing.

---

## Keyboard

Press **?** in either window, or open the **⚙** in the converter.

**Converter** — `↑` `↓` previous / next file · `Ctrl+O` add files · `Ctrl+↵` convert ·
`Esc` cancel · `E` eyedropper · `,` `.` step frames · `Ctrl`/`Alt`-click matte picking

**Viewer** — `F` fit · `1` actual pixels · `+` `−` zoom · `R` `G` `B` `A` channels ·
`C` colour · `E` eyedropper · `\` cycle A/B · `Esc` close

On a Mac, `Ctrl` is `⌘` and `Alt` is `⌥` — Ctrl-click is a right-click there, so
matte picking is `⌘`-click. The **?** sheet shows the Mac keys.

---

## Building

```bash
build_exe.bat
```

Runs `EXRtoSRGB.spec` with PyInstaller. The spec carries the parts that are easy to
get wrong: the OIIO/OCIO DLLs, the `ui/` folder, and pywebview's WebView2 backend.
The exe lands in the repo root; PyInstaller's scratch goes to `%TEMP%`.

On a Mac:

```bash
./build_mac.sh
```

Runs `EXRtoSRGB-mac.spec`, signs the bundle ad hoc, and writes
`dist/EXR to sRGB.app` plus a `.dmg` for the release page. It makes its own
`.venv` (marked for Dropbox to ignore) if there isn't one. `make_icns.py`
regenerates `app.icns` from `app.ico`.

---

## How it's built

`core.py` is the conversion — colour pipeline, layer resolution, alpha handling,
sequence grouping, cryptomatte. It imports no UI and is what the test suite
exercises, so colour behaviour is verifiable without opening a window.

`exr2srgb.py` is a [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/) window: Python stays
the application and the interface is HTML and CSS rendered by the OS's own webview
(WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS), which is why there's no bundled browser and the download is
around 37 MB rather than 150.
