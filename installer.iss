; Inno Setup script for EXR -> sRGB.
;
; Per-user by design. Everything this app touches is already per-user - the .exr
; association and the convert verbs live under HKCU\Software\Classes - so a
; machine-wide install would need elevation to place files and then still have
; to drop back to the signed-in user to register anything. Installing to
; %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs means no UAC prompt at all, and the app still appears
; in Add/Remove Programs like any other.
;
; The installed exe deliberately has a stable name at a stable path. Windows
; records that path in the association, so a filename carrying the version
; breaks the double-click on every upgrade - which is exactly what happened in
; 3.0.4. The version lives in the installer's filename, the uninstall entry and
; the file properties instead.
;
; Build:  python build_installer.py
; That reads VERSION out of exr2srgb.py and passes it in as /DAppVersion, so the
; version lives in exactly one place. Building this file directly still works
; and falls back to 0.0.0.

; The app cannot answer Restart Manager's graceful shutdown request, so
; asking politely and then giving up is what produced "DeleteFile failed;
; code 5. Access is denied." on the exe during an in-app update. Measured:
; RmGetList finds both processes (the one-file build is a bootloader plus its
; child), Setup logs "Shutting down applications using our files", nothing
; closes, and the file replace then fails on a locked file. `force` makes
; Setup terminate them instead of waiting on a reply that never comes.
;
; Do not rely on the app closing itself first. install_update() exits ~1.2s
; after launching Setup, which is a race it loses on a fast machine - and the
; bootloader lingers after that, deleting its 37 MB _MEI scratch directory.

[Run]
; The app owns the registration, so the installer calls it rather than writing
; a second copy of those registry keys in Pascal that then drifts from the

; Its own entry, gated on its own task. Until 3.1 both registrations rode on
; the assoc checkbox, so ticking only the right-click menu did nothing at all
; and ticking only the association installed the menu as well.

    Flags: runhidden waituntilterminated; Tasks: context

; Registering is not the same as becoming the default, and on any machine with
; Photoshop, After Effects or another EXR viewer on it the registration above
; is outranked and completely inert. Since Windows 8 the default handler is
; `UserChoice`, whose hash is signed per user - no installer can write it, and
; a forged one makes Windows drop the association altogether. The only way is
; Windows' own "How do you want to open this?" dialog, so it is shown once,
; here, while the user is already thinking about it. Not runhidden: it IS a
; window. Skipped silently if .exr already resolves to us.
; The prompt is for interactive installs only. It opens a window and waits on
; it - on Windows 11 the Default apps page in Settings - which is right when
; someone is running Setup and watching it, and wrong when the app is updating
; itself. An in-app update is silent by definition: Settings would appear
; unasked and Setup would sit there until it was dismissed. Only reachable at
; all since 3.2.6, because before that the file replace failed first.
