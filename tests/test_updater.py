"""
The in-app updater.

This is the one code path that ends in running an executable, so the checks
around it are the feature. Three things have to hold before anything is run:
the URL is an asset of this repository over https, the length matches what the
API said, and the SHA-256 matches the digest the API published.

A failure must also leave nothing behind - a half-written installer sitting in
the temp folder is exactly what a later run would find and trust.
